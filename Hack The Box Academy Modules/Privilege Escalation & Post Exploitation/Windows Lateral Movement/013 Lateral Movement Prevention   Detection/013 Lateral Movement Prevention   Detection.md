<h1>Lateral Movement Prevention &amp; Detection</h1>
<p>Throughout this module, we have explored multiple lateral movement methods within a network, leveraging tools such as <code>PsExec</code>, <code>WMIExec</code>, <code>DCOM</code>, and others. We have gone through how to infiltrate other systems on the network by understanding and applying these diverse techniques. Now it's time to talk about defenses.</p>
<p>Detecting and preventing lateral movement is crucial to safeguard sensitive data and maintain network integrity. This involves implementing various strategies and controls to monitor suspicious activities and restrict unauthorized access. Effective lateral movement prevention comprises measures such as network segmentation, enforcing least privilege, and implementing zero trust architecture, while detection strategies involve monitoring authentication logs, analyzing network traffic, and deploying honeypots. By integrating both preventive and detection mechanisms, we can significantly reduce the risk and impact of lateral movement, ensuring a robust defense against advanced threats.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Authentication Logs</h2>
<p>Monitoring authentication logs involves scrutinizing login activity to identify unusual patterns. For example, logins from unexpected locations or at odd hours can indicate unauthorized access attempts. Similarly, multiple failed login attempts and account lockouts signal that an attacker is trying to brute-force passwords or use stolen credentials.</p>
<p>To monitor unusual login patterns, we can use <code>Windows Event Viewer</code> or dedicated tools to analyze authentication logs. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>We must open <code>Event Viewer</code> by pressing <code>Win + R</code>, type <code>eventvwr</code>, and press <code>Enter</code>:</p>

<p>Navigate to <code>Windows Logs</code> &gt; <code>Security</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="text" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/263/Windows_Logs_Security.png"/></p>
<p>After that, we must filter by Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4625 (failed logon). To filter, we can right-click <code>Security</code> and select <code>Filter Current Log</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="text" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/263/Filter_Current_Log.png"/></p>
<p>Now, let's input the event IDs and click OK.</p>
<p><img alt="text" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/263/Input_Event_IDs.png"/></p>
<p>Finally, we can review the timestamps to identify logins outside normal working hours and examine the <code>Logon Information</code> section to identify unusual IP addresses:</p>

<p>It is impractical to monitor logs manually. Automated tools can help us understand how our network behaves and identify any unusual activity.

<h2>Honeypots and Deception</h2>
<p>A honeypot is an artificial environment designed to mimic real systems to observe and analyze the behavior of attackers. This approach is widely used in cybersecurity to create a deceptive trap that attracts cybercriminals. By deploying a honeypot, we can gain insights into the tactics and methods used by attackers, which helps in strengthening the overall security posture of their networks by addressing vulnerabilities identified during these interactions.</p>
<p>Deploying honeypots can be done using tools like <a href="https://www.kfsensor.net">KFSensor</a>. <a href="https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame">sshesame</a> or setting up a fake share on a Windows system.</p>
<h2>Network Traffic Analysis</h2>
<p>Network traffic analysis involves examining the flow of data across the network to identify unusual communication patterns. Attackers often engage in lateral communications between systems that don’t typically interact. Detecting such patterns can be a signal of lateral movement. Additionally, the use of non-standard ports or protocols can indicate attempts to bypass security measures.</p>
<p>Analyzing network flows requires using tools like Windows Performance Monitor or third-party applications such as <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> or Microsoft Network Monitor.</p>
<h2>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</h2>
<p>We can use <code>EDR</code> solutions to monitor and analyze endpoint behavior for signs of suspicious activities, such as the execution of malicious scripts or tools like <code>PsExec</code>, <code>PowerShell</code>, or <code>WMI</code>. These tools can be used by attackers to move laterally within the network, so detecting their usage can indicate potential compromise. Using <code>EDR</code> solutions involves deploying <code>EDR</code> software and configuring it to monitor endpoint activities.</p>
<h1>Prevention for Lateral Movement</h1>
<h2>Network Segmentation</h2>
<p>Network segmentation involves dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to restrict the lateral movement of attackers. Each segment should have strict access controls to ensure that only authorized traffic can pass between them. This reduces the risk of a compromised system impacting other areas of the network.</p>
<p>We can use tools like <code>Windows Firewall</code> to create VLANs and subnets, configure firewall rules to control traffic between segments, and regularly review these rules for compliance.</p>
<h2>Least Privilege</h2>
<p>Implementing the least privilege principle can substantially decrease the likelihood of lateral movement. This principle entails providing users and applications with only the essential permissions required to carry out their functions. Should an attacker gain control of a user account or application, their actions are confined to the permissions allocated to that account or application, thereby restricting their capacity to move laterally within the network.</p>
<p>We can apply the principle of least privilege by assigning roles and permissions through Active Directory (AD), enforcing least privilege via Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and auditing user permissions to revoke unnecessary rights.</p>
<h2>Zero Trust Architecture</h2>
<p>Finally, another way of protection can be Zero trust architecture. This is a security model where no entity is trusted by default. Every access request must be verified and authenticated, regardless of its origin, to ensure comprehensive security.</p>
<p>We can use <code>Azure Active Directory Conditional Access</code> to enforce verification for every request, apply network micro-segmentation, and continuously monitor and adjust access policies based on threat levels.</p>
