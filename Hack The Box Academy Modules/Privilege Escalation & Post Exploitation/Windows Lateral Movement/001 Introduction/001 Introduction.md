<h2>Introduction to Windows Lateral Movement</h2>
<p>Lateral movement refers to the techniques we use to move through a network after gaining initial access. By understanding lateral movement, attackers and defenders can better navigate and secure networks. This knowledge allows defenders to implement more effective security measures and helps attackers identify and exploit weaknesses in network defenses, ultimately leading to a more robust and resilient security posture.</p>
<h2>Description of Lateral Movement</h2>
<p>Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network, often with the goal of escalating privileges or accessing sensitive data. Using lateral movement techniques, we can move deeper into a network in search of credentials, sensitive data, and other high-value assets.</p>
<p>To perform a lateral movement, we need any form of credentials, including passwords, hashes, tickets, SSH keys, and session cookies. We can leverage those to connect to a remote computer in the network. Effective lateral movement requires a deep understanding of network architectures and the ability to identify services and protocols we can leverage to execute code on remote systems.</p>
<h2>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</a> defines lateral movement as techniques used to enter and control remote systems on a network. This often involves exploring the network, pivoting through multiple systems and accounts, and using either remote access tools or legitimate credentials with native tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> lists several techniques for lateral movement, including:</p>

<p>These techniques illustrate the various methods we can use to navigate and control remote systems within a network.</p>
<h2>Networks &amp; Systems</h2>
<p>Understanding how networks and systems work is crucial to performing lateral movement. Our initial step is to identify or map the network devices that we can target; we can do that through port scanning, ping sweep, or using Active Directory information.</p>
<p>Once we understand the network, we need to be aware that some systems may be out of reach because of network segmentation or firewall restrictions. In those cases, we need to think outside the box to get access to those services. Let's divide these scenarios into direct lateral movement and indirect lateral movement.</p>
<h3>Direct Lateral Movement</h3>
<p>Direct lateral movement is where we can execute commands directly on the target machine and force the target machine to connect back to us. For example, if we compromise SRV01 and need to move laterally to SRV02, we can use PSExec from SRV01 to execute commands on SRV02 and obtain a session or shell on SRV02.</p>

<h3>Indirect Lateral Movement</h3>
<p>Indirect lateral movement involves executing commands on the target machine when it receives instructions from another system. For example, suppose we can't reach SRV02 directly from SRV01 due to a network firewall restriction, but SRV02 can connect to the Windows Update Server (WSUS). In this case, if we compromise the WSUS server and create a fake Windows Update that executes our desired command, once SRV02 retrieves the update, it will run our malicious update, allowing us to obtain a shell on SRV02.</p>
<p><img alt="text" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/263/indirectlateralmovement.png"/></p>
<p>In the following section, we will create some examples for testing both scenarios.</p>
<h2>Command Execution</h2>
<p>As we see, command execution is very important when working with lateral movement. The ability to execute commands can help us gain access to remote services. Throughout this module, we will use different methods to execute commands or payloads that will be helpful when dealing with networks that employ various security mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Topology of the Lab</h2>
<p>To provide hands-on experience, the lab topology will simulate a typical corporate network environment, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Multiple network segments</strong>: Representing different departments or security zones.</li>
<li>
<strong>Key infrastructure components</strong>: Domain controllers, update servers, and management servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will practice identifying and exploiting lateral movement opportunities, reinforcing our understanding of the techniques and defenses discussed.</p>
<h2>Network Segmentation</h2>
<p>Understanding network segmentation is crucial for effectively performing lateral movement as attackers. Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of an attack. Proper network segmentation can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Contain breaches</strong>: Restrict our movement and reduce the attack surface.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enhance monitoring</strong>: Allow for more focused and effective monitoring of network traffic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improve access control</strong>: Enforce strict access policies between different segments.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="text" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/263/topologysetup.png"/></p>
<p>In the above image, we can see a high-level overview of the network topology. There are three network segments, and the device that determines which network can reach the other is the Switch Layer 3. In other networks, this device can be a router, a Linux server, or a firewall. Understanding how these devices control communication between segments is essential for planning lateral movement.</p>
<p>Through testing, we can identify which communication is allowed, but in this case, we will start the engagement from an assumed breach scenario.</p>
<p>Not all servers will be available in every section; sometimes, we will start from a different server. This variability highlights the importance of understanding network segmentation and its impact on our ability to move laterally.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, we will have a solid foundation in Windows lateral movement, providing us with the knowledge to carry out and defend against these advanced attacks.</p>
