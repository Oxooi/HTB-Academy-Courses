<h1>Introduction to Aircrack-ng</h1>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng">Aircrack-ng</a> comprises a comprehensive suite of tools designed for the evaluation of WiFi network security. Prior to initiating any endeavors to analyze or exploit wireless networks, a foundational understanding of the functionalities inherent within these tools is imperative.</p>
<p>Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Monitoring</code>: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.</li>
<li>
<code>Attacking</code>: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.</li>
<li>
<code>Testing</code>: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).</li>
<li>
<code>Cracking</code>: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).</li>
</ul>
<p>All tools within Aircrack-ng operate through command-line interfaces, facilitating extensive scripting capabilities. This attribute has been leveraged by numerous graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Aircrack-ng predominantly functions on Linux platforms but extends compatibility to Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and even eComStation 2.</p>
<p>The Aircrack-ng suite encompasses over 20 tools tailored for auditing Wi-Fi networks. We'll concentrate on the six most frequently utilized and essential tools within the suite. These tools are indispensable for various Wi-Fi security auditing tasks and are commonly sought after by users seeking comprehensive network assessment and protection.</p>
