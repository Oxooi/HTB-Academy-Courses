<h1>MiTM Overview</h1>
<hr/>
<p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attack is a cybersecurity threat where an attacker secretly intercepts and relays communication between two unsuspecting parties who believe they are directly connected. By positioning themselves between the participants, the attacker impersonates both sides, gaining the ability to capture, monitor, and manipulate sensitive information without detection. This can occur in various scenarios, such as intercepting HTTP transactions between a client and server by splitting the original connection into two separate links. Acting as a proxy, the attacker can read, modify, or inject data, posing serious risks to data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
<p>An attacker can deploy a Rogue Access Point (AP) to trick victims into connecting to it. Once connected, the attacker gains a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) position, effectively routing all the victim's traffic through the rogue AP's gateway. This allows the attacker to intercept, monitor, and manipulate network traffic, posing significant risks to the victim's data privacy and security.</p>

<h2>How MiTM Works:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<code>Configure the routing</code> : The attacker configures the routing, along with setting up the DNS and DHCP servers for the fake access point. These services will assign IP addresses to connected clients and handle their network requests, ensuring seamless connectivity that mimics the legitimate access point.</li>
<li>
<code>Set Up Rogue AP</code>: The attacker creates a fake Wi-Fi network with the same name (SSID) as a legitimate one, often using tools like wifipumpkin3, airbase-ng, or hostapd.</li>
<li>
<code>Deauthentication Attack</code> (Optional): To force victims off the legitimate network, the attacker sends deauthentication packets using tools like aireplay-ng, prompting users to reconnectâ€”often to the rogue AP.</li>
<li>
<code>Victim Connection</code>: The victim unknowingly connects to the attacker's AP, thinking it's a trusted network.</li>
<li>
<code>Traffic Interception</code>: The rogue AP captures all data exchanged between the victim and external services, enabling the attacker to monitor communications (e.g., browsing activity), steal sensitive data (e.g., login credentials) and inject malicious content (e.g., phishing pages).</li>
<li>
<code>Captive Portal</code> (Optional): The attacker sets up a fake login page that appears when the victim connects to the rogue AP, tricking them into providing credentials.</li>
<li>
<code>DNS Spoofing</code> or <code>SSL Stripping</code> (Optional): The attacker can redirect the victim to fake websites or downgrade secure connections to unencrypted ones.</li>
<li>
<code>SSL Interception</code> (Optional): The attacker intercepts and decrypts secure HTTPS traffic. This is done by providing the victim with a self-signed certificate. If the client accepts the self-signed certificate, the attacker can decrypt the encrypted HTTPS traffic.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>In the following sections, we will delve into some of the most common and dangerous Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks that can be carried out using a rogue access point. These attacks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>DNS Spoofing</code>: We will explore how an attacker can manipulate DNS responses to redirect a victim's traffic to malicious websites, even though the victim believes they are visiting legitimate sites. This technique is often used in phishing attacks to deceive users into entering sensitive information on counterfeit websites.</li>
<li>
<code>Phishing &amp; Bypassing MFA using Evilginx</code>: This section will focus on how attackers can bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems using Evilginx, a tool that acts as a reverse proxy to intercept and steal authentication tokens. This allows attackers to bypass MFA protections and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.</li>
<li>
<code>SSL Interception</code>: We will also cover SSL interception, where an attacker intercepts and decrypts secure HTTPS traffic. By acting as a man-in-the-middle, the attacker can decrypt encrypted communication between the victim and the legitimate server, gaining access to sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
