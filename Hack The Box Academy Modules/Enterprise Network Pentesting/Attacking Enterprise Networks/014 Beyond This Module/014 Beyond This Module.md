<h1>Beyond This Module</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Amazing work! You have made it to the end of the Attacking Enterprise Networks module and perhaps even the end of the Penetration Tester job role path. In the process you accomplished the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Hacked around 250 Targets</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>400+ module sections completed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>500+ challenge questions solved</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Over 750,000 words read</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those alone are significant achievements worthy of being proud!</p>
<p>If this is the final module you've completed in the path, take some time to write down or type out any concepts you feel weak in.</p>
<p><img alt="Concept Review List" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/163/ConceptReviewList.gif"/></p>
<p>Once you have finished writing out the concepts, go back through specific sections and review &amp; practice those concepts until you feel confident in each. <code>Global Search</code> can be used to discover these concepts and the exact sections they can be found in.</p>

<h2>Practice on the Main Platform</h2>
<p>As we Academy team members create modules, we remain mindful of the main platform and all it has to offer. We recommend that you do the same! Many of the concepts taught through Academy are also taught through the main platform in different ways. As we are sure you've noticed, Academy is in the form of guided courses. The main platform is more challenge-based, expecting learners to approach the challenges in a self-guided fashion.</p>
<p><code>Using both Academy and the main platform is an ideal learning experience</code>.</p>
<h4>Starting Point</h4>
<p>Starting Point has recently been revamped, influenced by the Academy style while maintaining the self-guided approach. There is three tiers (Tier 0, Tier 1, &amp; Tier 2) that are intentionally curated to increase in difficulty. Each box has accompanying guided questions and an engaging writeup should learners need it. Check out the quick tour below to see for yourself.</p>
<p><img alt="Starting Point Tour" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/163/QuickStartingPointTour.gif"/></p>
<p>One good practice goal would be to finish all currently published Starting Point machines.</p>
<h4>Tracks</h4>
<p><code>Tracks</code> are curated pathways made up of challenges and machines. A track can be chosen based on a specific topic or skill you would like to get better at. Check out the quick tour below to see a list of some of the Tracks that are currently available.</p>
<p><img alt="Tracks Tour" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/163/QuickTracksTour.gif"/></p>
<p>Another good practice goal is to complete a Track that will help you strengthen your understanding of a concept on the Concept Review List that was mentioned earlier in this section.</p>
<h4>Pro Labs</h4>
<p><code>Pro Labs</code> are perhaps the most realistic learning experiences that HTB has to offer. Each Pro Lab is modeled after an Enterprise-grade IT environment where learners must approach the lab in the same manner they would a real life pentest and with very little information. More details about each Pro Lab can be found in each respective lab's overview page on the main platform.</p>

<h2>Give Back</h2>
<p>Everyone reading this undoubtedly learned a lot throughout the completion of the path. Perhaps even enough to start assisting others in the community. We recommend you use your knowledge and skills to help others.</p>
<p><code>What better place to start helping others than in the HTB Academy Discord channels?</code></p>
<p>Of course it is not mandatory, but it could help someone else if you give them a nudge or explain a complicated concept. Many of us on the Academy team have realized that as we assist others and turn our knowledge into educational experiences, we learn exponentially more ourselves. Also, as an added bonus you may strengthen your soft skills in the process of helping others. Helping out in the Discord channels isn't the only way to give back.</p>
<p>Other ways could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start an Educational YouTube Channel</li>
<li>Create a blog containing technical and non-technical writeups</li>
<li>Share short tips &amp; tricks on social media</li>
<li>Start a live learning community to encourage others to keep building skills</li>
<li>Assist others with Resume Development &amp; Career Search</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Start Looking for Work</h2>
<p>We here on the Academy team know that the skills built during the completion of this path are employable technical &amp; research abilities that are in high demand out in the workforce. That said, there are also important soft skills needed to succeed as a penetration tester.</p>
<p>Skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication &amp; Presentation abilities</li>
<li>Team work</li>
<li>Writing (Documentation, Reports, Email communication, Resume Writing)</li>
<li>Emotional Intelligence</li>
<li>Courage</li>
<li>Good Ethical Habits</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these soft skills can only be built through intentional practice. While you do not need to be an extravert &amp;/or "social butterfly" to succeed in this field, it is of great benefit to be able to communicate effectively to other people. This can be done with your close friends and loved ones, but also with people you meet on your learning journey. Try explaining what you learned to others you know and even share with them  what you've experienced throughout your journey. This kind of interaction can serve as preparation for interviews and other formal interactions that may happen in the course of your career. Speaking of careers, if you aren't already employed as a Penetration Tester, <code>start looking and applying for job opportunities!</code> In this day and age there are countless traditional and non-traditional ways of finding work in the industry and organizations are in dire need of high quality help.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to start looking for work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting Hiring Managers at Industry Recognized Conferences</li>
<li>Being a very helpful contributor in Infosec-focused Discord channels and communities</li>
<li>Linkedin Job Posts</li>
<li>Indeed Job Posts</li>
<li>Ziprecruiter Job Posts</li>
<li>Word of Mouth (someone else recommending you)</li>
<li>Through HTB's Talent Search</li>
</ul>
<p>With the right amount of focus, time and effort we believe you will find the right opportunity or the right opportunity may even find you.</p>
