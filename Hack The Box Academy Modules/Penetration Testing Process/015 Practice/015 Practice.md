<h1>Practice</h1>
<hr/>
<p>All the theories in the world will be of no use to us if we cannot transfer them into practice and apply our knowledge to real-world, hands-on situations. Putting the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) we have covered in the Penetration Tester path into use frequently is the best thing we could do to keep our skills sharp and ensure that when it comes time to put them to work in a customer's environment, we are sure of ourselves and the potential impact our actions may have. Technical skills are only half the battle, however. We also need excellent written and verbal communication skills to be effective penetration testers. This includes seemingly minor things like being able to write a clear and professional email and present and defend our work during a client meeting and through a professional report.</p>
<p>You will often find yourself working with a team in this field, and as a team, we can help each other grow and hone our skills. Need to practice leading a kickoff call with a customer? Have a friend or teammate act as a fictitious customer. Use that time to practice asking your initial scoping questions and defining the pentest you expect to deliver. These same actions can be used when practicing delivering your post-engagement report walkthrough briefing for a client.</p>
<p>Penetration testing is fun. We get to attack a network and act like real-world hackers for a period of time. What some people may find boring, however, is an essential part: thorough documentation and strong reporting skills. A client won't be able to do much with a vague two-page report (the same way a two-section module wouldn't do you much good). If we were contracted by a Fortune 500 company and able to take control of their entire domain without triggering an alarm, we'll need to be able to prove it. If we can't back up our assertions with clear evidence, we'll lose credibility, and our work will be called into question.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we have 50+ pages of documentation, we have considerably more evidence to back up our work and we're more likely to make an impression on the decision-makers in the client company. That being said, if our presentation is sloppy and the report is difficult to follow or does not go in-depth on vulnerability reproduction steps and give clear remediation recommendations, or the executive summary is poorly written, our hard work will not be well-received. Documentation and reporting (including how to write a high-quality report) will be covered in another module. This module also gives many suggestions and resources for practicing this critical soft skill.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary fade show" role="alert">
<i class="mdi mdi-information-outline mr-2"></i> Note: When working on a pentest team, we would often practice client kickoff calls and report review meetings with each other. We practiced reviewing the results and drilled each other on our report content and the recommendations we gave to our clients. When our clients asked questions or disputed our recommendations, we were prepared to handle the situation and could answer clearly on the spot as to why we would recommend a specific fix. This type of practice will surely give you a more polished and professional look.

<p>As crucial as the client-facing portions of a penetration test are, they won't much matter if we don't practice our hands-on keyboard skills. Practicing will help us see what comes naturally to us and what areas we need to improve. Reading is not a replacement for hands-on practice (though written theory is crucial for developing a deep understanding of the myriad of topics we cover). Once certain tasks become second nature through considerable practice, we will save time and energy that can be used to dig deep on client assessments or for our own research and analysis.</p>
<p>We may be wizards in web exploitation but struggle when facing an Active Directory environment. Ideally, you will practice in lab environments that match your clients. ( If you often pentest against organizations that use specific equipment like the medical field, ideally, you will have replications of common devices you could encounter to test against.) But that's not always feasible. So what can you do? Well, in Hack The Box, we have many different ways for you to hone your skills. Everything from the active machines to challenges to Prolabs and Battlegrounds can be used to get further hands-on experience dealing with all classes of vulnerabilities. The modules here in HTB Academy provide an excellent resource to practice our skills. Many of the modules in the Penetration Tester Job Role Path feature labs that can be approached as mock penetration tests. This repetition may be tedious on the front end, but it will save countless hours that we can use to continue improving. The steps below can help guide us on a path to practicing what we have learned:</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Practicing Steps</h2>
<p>Think about the skills you have gained and what interests you the most from them. From there, we can pick out a few more modules to increase our knowledge, machines to practice on, and Prolabs or Endgames to really put ourselves to the test. The numbers below are a good starting example:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Modules</li>
<li>3x Retired Machines</li>
<li>5x Active Machines</li>
<li>1x Pro Lab / Endgame</li>
</ul>
<h4>Modules</h4>
<p>The modules chosen should be categorized according to <code>two different difficulties</code>: <code>technical</code> and <code>offensive</code>. We use these to familiarize ourselves with the attacks and the possibilities and develop an accurate picture and understanding of those attacks. Then we use the provided exercises and their machines to learn to apply these techniques and, at the same time to create efficient <code>notes</code> and <code>screenshots</code> for accurate<code> documentation</code>. Here is a good blueprint for tackling a module:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Step</strong></th>
<th><strong>Task</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1.</td>
<td>Read the module</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Practice the exercises</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Complete the module</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Start the module exercises from scratch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.</td>
<td>While solving the exercises again, take notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6.</td>
<td>Create technical documentation based on the notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7.</td>
<td>Create non-technical documentation based on the notes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The selection of several modules allows us to deal with different technologies and issues we may face. We will discover various aspects that need to be considered and sometimes documented/notated in more detail than before. These notes will be quite valuable as we move along in our careers. Some pairings of technologies and attack vectors can be rare to see in the wild, so having detailed notes about those systems from when you interacted with them will help you progress through an assessment quicker where you encounter them.</p>
<p>After completing the module, we should create minor <code>technical</code> and <code>non-technical</code> documentation (i.e., create sample technical findings and reproduction steps and executive summary entries that could be included in a report). Focus on practicing creating "client-ready" documentation. Many people underestimate the amount of knowledge and skills that are imprinted through the creation of the documentation. Practicing writing documentation can help cement some topics in our minds and make it easier for us to explain concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
<h4>Retired Machines</h4>
<p>When we have completed (at least) two modules and are satisfied with our notes and documentation, we can select three different retired machines. These should also differ in difficulty, but we recommend choosing <code>two easy</code> and <code>one medium</code> machines. At the end of each module, you will find recommended retired machines to consider that will help you practice the specific tools and topics covered in the module. These hosts will share one or more attack vectors tied to the module.</p>
<p>With the retired machines, we have a significant advantage in that we can find existing write-ups online from many different authors (all with varying approaches) with which we can compare our notes. If we opt to purchase a VIP membership on the HTB main platform, we will also have access to official HTB write-ups that present another viewpoint and often include some defensive considerations. We can use these write-ups to compare whether we have noted everything necessary and have not overlooked anything. The order in which we can proceed to practice with the retired machines looks something like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Step</strong></th>
<th><strong>Task</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1.</td>
<td>Get the user flag on your own</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Get the root flag on your own</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Write your technical documentation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Write your non-technical documentation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.</td>
<td>Compare your notes with the official write-up (or a community write-up if you don't have a VIP subscription</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6.</td>
<td>Create a list of information you have missed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7.</td>
<td>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA">Ippsec's</a> walkthrough and compare it with your notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8.</td>
<td>Expand your notes and documentation by adding the missed parts</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, we should create <code>technical</code> and <code>non-technical</code> documentation again. We will find that this one will likely be more extensive than the previous ones because we are working with many more topics we need to cover and document here. The most significant advantage of this approach is that we go through the entire penetration testing process, improving the way we capture essential information and have everything we need to prepare our documentation based on our experiences and notes.</p>
<h4>Active Machines</h4>
<p>After building a good foundation with the modules and the retired machines, we can venture to <code>two easy</code>, <code>two medium</code>, and <code>one hard</code> active machine. We can also take these from the corresponding module recommendations at the end of each module in Academy.</p>
<p>The advantage of this method is that we simulate as realistic a situation as possible using a single host that we have no familiarity with and cannot find documentation on (blackbox approach). As long as the machine remains active, no official write-ups will be published. This means that we cannot check whether we have everything or whether we have missed something from any official source. This puts us in the situation of relying on ourselves and our abilities. Ideal practice steps for active machines would look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Step</strong></th>
<th><strong>Task</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1.</td>
<td>Get the user and root flag</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Write your technical documentation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Write your non-technical documentation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Have it proofread by technical and non-technical persons</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Proofreading gives us our first impressions of how the readers receive the two types of documentation. This gives us an idea of which aspects of our documentation need to be improved for both technical and non-technical audiences. As we can already imagine, not many non-technical people are interested in reading this type of documentation. Therefore, we need to design the non-technical documentation to be <code>informative</code>, <code>high quality</code>, and kept <code>concise</code> but meaningful and free of highly technical jargon. More about this is covered in the <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/162">Documentation &amp; Reporting</a> module.</p>
<h4>Pro Lab/Endgame</h4>
<p>Once we feel comfortable going against singular hosts and documenting our findings, we can take on Prolabs and Endgames. These labs are large multi-host environments that often simulate enterprise networks of varying sizes similar to those we could run into during actual penetration tests for our clients. This will present us with different challenges than we are used to. We will no longer be focusing on a single host and now have to consider how the different hosts interact with each other. These interactions will make for new and interesting vectors we can potentially practice against as well. For example, running a tool like <code>Responder</code> in an Active Directory environment to see traffic and capture a user's password hash or some sort of user interaction is much more likely in a simulated network than when attacking a single box. Attacking infrastructure with several interconnected hosts and network components will create additional connections we need to consider in our documentation. Instead of showing how to complete a single host from start to finish, we will need to practice writing up an entire attack chain, showing our path from foothold to network compromise. This, again, is covered in the <code>Documentation &amp; Reporting</code> module. The practice we have from the previous tasks will make this much easier for us as everything builds on each other.</p>

<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
<p>We have covered a considerable amount of information in this module. If you are just beginning the <code>Penetration Tester</code> Job Role path, we recommend continuing in the order in which the modules are presented. If we are new to all this, skipping around could lead to gaps in knowledge and make certain modules difficult to finish without prerequisite knowledge. If you are already partially through the path, it's worth going back through modules that you have already completed and consider the various steps in the context of the penetration testing process presented in this module.</p>
<p>Continuous practice and improvement are vital regardless of where you are in your journey. We can continuously improve on our current methodology, learn things differently, and learn new concepts. The field of information technology changes rapidly. New attacks are discovered frequently, and we need to stay on top of the latest and greatest TTPs to be as effective as possible and provide our clients with the necessary information to help secure their environments from an ever-evolving threat landscape. Never stop learning and improving. Challenge yourself daily. Take breaks. Enjoy the journey, and don't forget to <code>Think Outside The Box</code>!</p>
