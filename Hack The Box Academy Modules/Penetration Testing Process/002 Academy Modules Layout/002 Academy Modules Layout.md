<p>Hack The Box was initially created to give technical professionals a safe place to practice and develop hacking skills and was not ideally suited for beginners starting their IT/Security journeys. Hack The Box began as solely a competitive CTF platform with a mix of machines and challenges, each awarding varying amounts of points depending on the difficulty, to be solved from a "black box" approach, with no walkthrough, guidance, or even hints. As the platform evolved, we saw the need for more beginner-friendly content and a guided learning approach to supplement the competitive side of the platform. With that goal in mind, HTB Academy was born. We aim to provide beginner-friendly content while helping mid-level and advanced practitioners upskill in various areas. We also offer Starting Point on the main HTB platform, which aims to help users become more comfortable attacking individual targets using a guided approach and eventually transitioning to solving boxes independently and even playing the competitive boxes. Each person likely has their personal opinion of HTB, and it may not be for everyone. However, we would like to take the time to explain our point of view as experienced IT specialists from various fields, with many years of combined experience and different journeys from beginners to where we are today.</p>
<p>IT (Information Technology) is a major business function of most organizations that focuses on building, administering, and supporting the computer technology used by organizations to achieve their mission. IT is a term often used to encompass many specialized sub-disciplines like Cybersecurity, Information Security, Software Development, Database Administration, Network Administration, and more. To become "good" in this field requires considerable practice and effort. Cyber security can be a very challenging discipline because it requires the basic knowledge necessary for a typical IT specialist and a much deeper understanding of all areas (networking, Linux and Windows systems administration, scripting, databases, etc.). We don't need to be experts in every single area of IT. However, the more experience and knowledge we have, the easier our job as an IT security specialist or penetration tester will become. We cannot work confidently as penetration testers if we don't have a deep understanding of the technologies we are assessing. For example, a web developer focuses only on developing web applications and websites. This generally requires knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, and server-side programming languages, such as PHP. Even if the developer has over ten years of experience in his field, it only takes one mistake for the entire web server to be unusable or for data to be stolen. As an attacker, the trick is to find a way to identify and exploit these errors.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we have laid a foundation for our students because, in our experience, it is hard to know where to start. We have structured and built our learning material so that it may seem difficult <code>at first</code>, but with time you will realize that this is the easiest and most efficient way to teach such complex material efficiently. We want to make the learning process as easy and efficient as possible while emphasizing the core fundamentals and returning to them repeatedly. For example, many of our tasks are set up to get you to think in a certain way. We do this to help you develop the essential analytical skills that are imperative to be successful in a field that can have so much uncertainty. We want to help craft professionals who see things differently and question everything, which ultimately can help deliver more value to clients if you're able to find nuanced issues that other testers miss. We can't teach analytical skills and the ability to dig deeper and "question everything" in one single module or path. This can be compared to playing a musical instrument. We can't learn to play the guitar well without considerable practice. We can learn everything about a guitar, the history of guitars, the name of every component, etc., but if we pick one up without practice, we will not be able to produce music that is equivalent to our knowledge of guitars. This is the same in the field of penetration testing. We may know everything about the history of computers and be able to describe every component, but without deep hands-on experience, we won't be able to perform penetration testing at a high level.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section will explain how we have structured the modules in the way that we did to give you insight into our thought process and teaching philosophy. Our primary focus is creating engaging and empowering training resources that benefit individuals at  <code>ALL</code> skill levels.</p>

<h2>Pre-Engagement</h2>
<p>The pre-engagement stage is where the main commitments, tasks, scope, limitations, and related agreements are documented in writing. During this stage, contractual documents are drawn up, and essential information is exchanged that is relevant for penetration testers and the client, depending on the type of assessment.</p>

<td>Next, we move towards the <code>Information Gathering</code> stage. Before any target systems can be examined and attacked, we must first identify them. It may well be that the customer will not give us any information about their network and components other than a domain name or just a listing of in-scope IP addresses/network ranges. Therefore, we need to get an overview of the target web application(s) or network before proceeding further.</td>

<p>Web applications represent a separate category. We are comfortable using a web browser and browsing websites. But what happens behind the scenes when we interact with a web application? Before attacking web applications, we must focus on how they function and the processes that occur on the backend when using a web application.</p>

<p>As we know, large IT networks need to be closely managed and secured. Most companies have a management structure, as managing hundreds or thousands of systems remotely or physically one by one would be unreasonable.

<h2>Information Gathering</h2>
<p>Information gathering is an essential part of any assessment. Because information, the knowledge gained from it, the conclusions we draw, and the steps we take are based on the information available. This information must be obtained from somewhere, so it is critical to know how to retrieve it and best leverage it based on our assessment goals.</p>
<p><img alt="Penetration testing process: Pre-Engagement, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Assessment, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Lateral Movement, Proof-of-Concept, Post-Engagement." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-IG.png"/></p>

<td><code>Vulnerability Assessment</code></td>
<td>The next stop on our journey is <code>Vulnerability Assessment</code>, where we use the information found to identify potential weaknesses. We can use vulnerability scanners that will scan the target systems for known vulnerabilities and manual analysis where we try to look behind the scenes to discover where the potential vulnerabilities might lie.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The information we gather in advance will influence the results of the <code>Exploitation</code> stage. From this, we can see if we have collected enough or dived deep enough. Time, patience, and personal commitment all play a significant role in information gathering. This is when many penetration testers tend to jump straight into exploiting a potential vulnerability. This often fails and can lead, among other things, to a significant loss of time. Before attempting to exploit anything, we should have completed thorough information gathering, keeping detailed notes along the way, focusing on things to hone in on once we get to the exploitation stage. Most assessments are time-based, so we don't want to waste time bouncing around, which could lead to us missing something critical. Organization and patience are vital while being as thorough as possible.</p>

<p>The vulnerability assessment stage is divided into two areas. On the one hand, it is an approach to scan for known vulnerabilities using automated tools. On the other hand, it is analyzing for potential vulnerabilities through the information found. Many companies conduct regular vulnerability assessment audits to check their infrastructure for new known vulnerabilities and compare them with the latest entries in these tools' databases.</p>
<p>An analysis is more about <code>thinking outside the box</code>. We try to discover gaps and opportunities to trick the systems and applications to our advantage and gain unintended access or privileges. This requires creativity and a deep technical understanding. We must connect the various information points we obtain and understand its processes.</p>

<p>From this stage, there are four paths we can take, depending on how far we have come:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Path</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Exploitation</code></td>
<td>The first we can jump into is the <code>Exploitation</code> stage. This happens when we do not yet have access to a system or application. Of course, this assumes that we have already identified at least one gap and prepared everything necessary to attempt to exploit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Post-Exploitation</code></td>
<td>The second way leads to the <code>Post-Exploitation</code> stage, where we escalate privileges on the target system. This assumes that we are already on the target system and can interact with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Lateral Movement</code></td>
<td>Our third option is the <code>Lateral Movement</code> stage, where we move from the already exploited system through the network and attack other systems. Again, this assumes that we are already on a target system and can interact with it. However, privilege escalation is not strictly necessary because interacting with the system already allows us to move further in the network under certain circumstances. Other times we will need to escalate privileges before moving laterally. Every assessment is different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Information Gathering</code></td>
<td>The last option is returning to the <code>Information Gathering</code> stage when we do not have enough information on hand. Here we can dig deeper to find more information that will give us a more accurate view.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The ability to analyze comes with time and experience. However, it also needs to be trained because proper analysis makes connections between different points and information. Connecting this information about the target network or target system and our experience will often allow us to recognize specific patterns. We can compare this to reading. Once we have read certain words often enough, we will know that word at some point and understand what it means just by looking at the letters.</p>

<h2>Exploitation</h2>
<p>Exploitation is the attack performed against a system or application based on the potential vulnerability discovered during our information gathering and enumeration. We use the information from the <code>Information Gathering</code> stage, analyze it in the <code>Vulnerability Assessment</code> stage, and prepare the potential attacks. Often many companies and systems use the same applications but make different decisions about their configuration. This is because the same application can often be used for various purposes, and each organization will have different objectives.</p>

<table>

<th><strong>Path</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Information Gathering</code></td>
<td>Once we have initial access to the target system, regardless of how high our privileges are at that moment, we need to gather information about the local system. Whether we use this new information for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration does not matter. Therefore, before we can take any further steps, we need to find out what we are dealing with. This inevitably takes us to the vulnerability assessment stage, where we analyze and evaluate the information we find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Post-Exploitation</code></td>
<td><code>Post-exploitation</code> is mainly about escalating privileges if we have not yet attained the highest possible rights on the target host. As we know, more opportunities are open to us with higher privileges. This path actually includes the stages <code>Information Gathering</code>, <code>Vulnerability Assessment</code>, <code>Exploitation</code>, and <code>Lateral Movement</code> but from an internal perspective on the target system. The direct jump to post-exploitation is less frequent, but it does happen. Because through the exploitation stage, we may already have obtained the highest privileges, and from here on, we start again at <code>Information Gathering</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Lateral Movement</code></td>
<td>From here, we can also skip directly over to <code>Lateral Movement</code>. This can come under different conditions. If we have achieved the highest privileges on a dual-homed system used to connect two networks, we can likely use this host to start enumerating hosts that were not previously available to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Proof-of-Concept</code></td>
<td>We can take the last path after gaining the highest privileges by exploiting an internal system. Of course, we do not necessarily have to have taken over all systems. However, if we have gained the Domain Admin privileges in an Active Directory environment, we can likely move freely across the entire network and perform any actions we can imagine. So we can create the <code>Proof-of-Concept</code> from our notes to detail and potentially automate the paths and activities and make them available to the technical department.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This stage is so comprehensive that it has been divided into two distinct areas. The first category is general network protocols often used and present in almost every network. The actual exploitation of the potential and existing vulnerabilities is based on the adaptability and knowledge of the different network protocols we will be dealing with. In addition, we need to be able to create an overview of the existing network to understand its individual components' purposes. In most cases, web servers and applications contain a great deal of information that can be used against them. As stated previously, since web is a vast technical area in its own right, it will be treated separately. We are also interested in the remotely exposed services running on the target hosts, as these may have misconfigurations or known public vulnerabilities that we can leverage for initial access. Finally, existing users also play a significant role in the overall network.</p>

As a result, many different components come into play when dealing with web applications. This includes many kinds of databases that require differing command syntax to interact with. Due to the diversity of web applications available to companies and their prevalence worldwide, we must deal with this area separately and focus intently on it. Web applications present a vast attack surface and are often the main accessible targets during external penetration testing engagements, so strong web enumeration and exploitation skills are paramount.</p>

<h2>Post-Exploitation</h2>
<p>In most cases, when we exploit certain services for our purposes to gain access to the system, we usually do not obtain the highest possible privileges. Because services are typically configured in a certain way "isolated" to stop potential attackers, bypassing these restrictions is the next step we take in this stage. However, it is not always easy to escalate the privileges. After gaining in-depth knowledge about how these operating systems function, we must adapt our techniques to the particular operating system and carefully study how <code>Linux Privilege Escalation</code> and <code>Windows Privilege Escalation</code> work.</p>
<p><img alt="Penetration testing process: Pre-Engagement, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Assessment, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Lateral Movement, Proof-of-Concept, Post-Engagement." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-POEX.png"/></p>
<p>From this stage, there are four paths we can take, depending on how far we have come:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Path</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Information Gathering / Pillaging</code></td>
<td>Before we can begin escalating privileges, we must first get an overview of the inner workings of the exploited system. After all, we do not know which users are on the system and what options are available to us up to this point. This step is also known as <code>Pillaging</code>. This path is not optional, as with the others, but essential. Again, entering the <code>Information Gathering</code> stage puts us in this perspective. This inevitably takes us to the vulnerability assessment stage, where we analyze and evaluate the information we find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Exploitation</code></td>
<td>Suppose we have found sensitive information about the system and its' contents. In that case, we can use it to exploit local applications or services with higher privileges to execute commands with those privileges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Lateral Movement</code></td>
<td>From here, we can also skip directly over to <code>Lateral Movement</code>. This can come under different conditions. If we have achieved the highest privileges on a dual-homed system used to connect two networks, we can likely use this host to start enumerating hosts that were not previously available to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Proof-of-Concept</code></td>
<td>We can take the last path after gaining the highest privileges by exploiting an internal system. Of course, we do not necessarily have to have taken over all systems. However, if we have gained the Domain Admin privileges in an Active Directory environment, we can likely move freely across the entire network and perform any actions we can imagine. So we can create the <code>Proof-of-Concept</code> from our notes to detail and potentially automate the paths and activities and make them available to the technical department.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After we have gained access to a system, we must be able to take further steps from within the system. During a penetration test, customers often want to find out how far an attacker could go in their network. There are many different versions of operating systems. For example, we may run into Windows XP, Windows 7, 8, 10, 11, and Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019. There are also different distributions for Linux-based operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Parrot OS, Arch, Deepin, Redhat, Pop!_OS, and many others. No matter which of these systems we get into, we have to find our way around it and understand the individual weak points that a system can have from within.</p>

<h2>Lateral Movement</h2>
<p>Lateral movement is one of the essential components for moving through a corporate network. We can use it to overlap with other internal hosts and further escalate our privileges within the current subnet or another part of the network. However, just like <code>Pillaging</code>, the <code>Lateral Movement</code> stage requires access to at least one of the systems in the corporate network. In the Exploitation stage, the privileges gained do not play a critical role in the first instance since we can also move through the network without administrator rights.</p>
<p><img alt="Penetration testing process: Pre-Engagement, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Assessment, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Lateral Movement, Proof-of-Concept, Post-Engagement." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-LA.png"/></p>
<p>There are three paths we can take from this stage:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Path</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Vulnerability Assessment</code></td>
<td>If the penetration test is not finished yet, we can jump from here to the <code>Vulnerability Assessment</code> stage. Here, the information already obtained from pillaging is used and analyzed to assess where the network services or applications using an authentication mechanism that we may be able to exploit are running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Information Gathering / Pillaging</code></td>
<td>After a successful lateral movement, we can jump into <code>Pillaging</code> once again. This is local information gathering on the target system that we accessed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Proof-of-Concept</code></td>
<td>Once we have made the last possible lateral movement and completed our attack on the corporate network, we can summarize the information and steps we have collected and perhaps even automate certain sections that demonstrate vulnerability to the vulnerabilities we have found.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since both <code>Lateral Movement</code> and <code>Pillaging</code> require access to an already exploited system, these techniques and methods are covered in different modules, such as <code>Getting Started</code>, <code>Linux Privilege Escalation</code>, and <code>Windows Privilege Escalation</code>, and many others.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Proof-of-Concept</h2>
<p>The <code>Proof-Of-Concept</code> (<code>POC</code>) is merely proof that a vulnerability found exists. As soon as the administrators receive our report, they will try to confirm the vulnerabilities found by reproducing them. After all, no administrator will change business-critical processes without confirming the existence of a given vulnerability. A large network may have many interoperating systems and dependencies that must be checked after making a change, which can take a considerable amount of time and money. Just because a pentester found a given flaw, it doesn't mean that the organization can easily remediate it by just changing one system, as this could negatively affect the business. Administrators must carefully test fixes to ensure no other system is negatively impacted when a change is introduced. PoCs are sent along with the documentation as part of a high-quality penetration test, allowing administrators to use them to confirm the issues themselves.</p>

<p>From this stage, there is only one path we can take:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Path</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>

<tr>
<td><code>Post-Engagement</code></td>
<td>At this point, we can only go to the post-engagement stage, where we optimize and improve the documentation and send it to the customer after an intensive review.</td>

<td>Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, and it is also quite powerful. This makes it easy to automate many steps and, with the help of comments in our code, to understand exactly how the vulnerability is exploited step-by-step.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr/>
<h2>Post-Engagement</h2>
<p>The <code>Post-Engagement</code> stage also includes cleaning up the systems we exploit so that none of these systems can be exploited using our tools. For example, leaving a bind shell on a web server that does not require authentication and is easy to find will do the opposite of what we are trying to do. In this way, we endanger the network through our carelessness. Therefore, it is essential to remove all content that we have transferred to the systems during our penetration test so that the corporate network is left in the same state as before our penetration test. We also should note down any system changes, successful exploitation attempts, captured credentials, and uploaded files in the appendices of our report so our clients can cross-check this against any alerts they receive to prove that they were a result of our testing actions and not an actual attacker in the network.</p>
<p>In addition, we have to reconcile all our notes with the documentation we have written in the meantime to make sure we have not skipped any steps and can provide a comprehensive, well-formatted and neat report to our clients.</p>
