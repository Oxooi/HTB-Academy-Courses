<h1>Latest Email Service Vulnerabilities</h1>
<hr/>
<p>One of the most recent publicly disclosed and dangerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a> vulnerabilities was discovered in <a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">OpenSMTPD</a> up to version 6.6.2 service was in 2020. This vulnerability was assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7247">CVE-2020-7247</a> and leads to RCE. It has been exploitable since 2018. This service has been used in many different Linux distributions, such as Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, and others. The dangerous thing about this vulnerability is the possibility of executing system commands remotely on the system and that exploiting this vulnerability does not require authentication.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.shodan.io">Shodan.io</a>, at the time of writing (April 2022), there are over 5,000 publicly accessible OpenSMTPD servers worldwide, and the trend is growing. However, this does not mean that this vulnerability affects every service. Instead, we want to show you how significant the impact of an RCE would be in case this vulnerability were discovered now. However, of course, this applies to all other services as well.</p>

<h2>The Concept of the Attack</h2>
<p>As we already know, with the SMTP service, we can compose emails and send them to desired people. The vulnerability in this service lies in the program's code, namely in the function that records the sender's email address. This offers the possibility of escaping the function using a semicolon (<code>;</code>) and making the system execute arbitrary shell commands. However, there is a limit of 64 characters, which can be inserted as a command. The technical details of this vulnerability can be found <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/01/28/3">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The Concept of Attacks</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/attack_concept2.png"/></p>
<p>Here we need to initialize a connection with the SMTP service first. This can be automated by a script or entered manually. After the connection is established, an email must be composed in which we define the sender, the recipient, and the actual message for the recipient. The desired system command is inserted in the sender field connected to the sender address with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). As soon as we finish writing, the data entered is processed by the OpenSMTPD process.</p>

<tr>
<td><code>1.</code></td>

<td>As the destination, the entered information is forwarded to another local process.</td>

<p>This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>As we've seen, email attacks can lead to sensitive data disclosure through direct access to a user's inbox or by combining a misconfiguration with a convincing phishing email. There are other ways to attack email services that can be very effective as well. A few Hack The Box boxes demonstrate email attacks, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nnJq_IWJog">Rabbit</a>, which deals with brute-forcing Outlook Web Access (OWA) and then sending a document with a malicious macro to phish a user, <a href="https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/11/28/htb-sneakymailer.html">SneakyMailer</a> which has elements of phishing and enumerating a user's inbox using Netcat and an IMAP client, and <a href="https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/11/10/htb-reel.html">Reel</a> which dealt with brute-forcing SMTP users and phishing with a malicious RTF file.</p>
<p>It's worth playing these boxes, or at least watching the Ippsec video or reading a walkthrough to see examples of these attacks in action. This goes for any attack demonstrated in this module (or others). The site <a href="https://ippsec.rocks/?#">ippsec.rocks</a> can be used to search for common terms and will show which HTB boxes these appear in, which will reveal a wealth of targets to practice against.</p>
