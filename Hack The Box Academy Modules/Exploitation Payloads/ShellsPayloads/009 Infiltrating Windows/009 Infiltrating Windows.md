<h1>Infiltrating Windows</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Since many of us can remember, Microsoft has dominated the home and enterprise markets for computing. In modern days, with the introduction of improved Active Directory features, more interconnectivity with cloud services, Windows subsystem for Linux, and much more, the Microsoft attack surface has grown as well.</p>
<p>For example, just in the last five years, there have been <code>3688</code> reported vulnerabilities just within Microsoft Products, and this number grows daily. This table was derived from <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html">HERE</a></p>

<h2>Prominent Windows Exploits</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, several vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and their corresponding attacks are some of the most exploited vulnerabilities of our time. Let's discuss those for a minute:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Vulnerability</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>MS08-067</code></td>
<td>MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Eternal Blue</code></td>
<td>MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>PrintNightmare</code></td>
<td>A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it <a href="https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html">here</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>BlueKeep</code></td>
<td>CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Sigred</code></td>
<td>CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>SeriousSam</code></td>
<td>CVE 2021-36934 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the <code>C:\Windows\system32\config</code> folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Zerologon</code></td>
<td>CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.</td>
</tr>

<p>With these vulnerabilities in mind, Windows isn't going anywhere. We need to be proficient with identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and moving around in Windows hosts and environments. An understanding of these concepts can help us secure our environments from attack as well. Now it's time to dive in and explore some Windows-focused exploit fun.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Enumerating Windows &amp; Fingerprinting Methods</h2>
<p>This module assumes you have already performed your host enumeration phase and understand what services are commonly seen on hosts. We are just attempting to give you a few quick tricks to determine if a host is likely a Windows machine. Check out the <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/network-enumeration-with-nmap">Network Enumeration With NMAP</a>  module for a more detailed look at host enumeration and fingerprinting.</p>
<p>Since we have a set of targets, <code>what are a few ways to determine if the host is likely a Windows Machine</code>? To answer this question, we can look at a few things. The first one being the <code>Time To Live</code> (TTL) counter when utilizing ICMP to determine if the host is up. A typical response from a Windows host will either be 32 or 128. A response of or around 128 is the most common response you will see. This value may not always be exact, especially if you are not in the same layer three network as the target. We can utilize this value since most hosts will never be more than 20 hops away from your point of origin, so there is little chance of the TTL counter dropping into the acceptable values of another OS type. In the ping output  <code>below</code>, we can see an example of this. For the example, we pinged a Windows 10 host and can see we have received replies with a TTL of 128. Check out this <a href="https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/">link</a> for a nice table showing other TTL values by OS.</p>
<h4>Pinged Host</h4>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">[!bash!]$ ping 192.168.86.39 

PING 192.168.86.39 (192.168.86.39): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=0 ttl=128 time=102.920 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=9.164 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=2 ttl=128 time=14.223 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=3 ttl=128 time=11.265 ms
</code></pre>
<p>Another way we can validate if the host is Windows or not is to use our handy tool, <code>NMAP</code>. Nmap has a cool capability built in to help with OS identification and many other scripted scans to check for anything from a specific vulnerability to information gathered from SNMP. For this example, we will utilize the <code>-O</code> option with verbose output <code>-v</code> to initialize an OS Identification scan against our target <code>192.168.86.39</code>. As we scroll through the shell session below and look at the results, a few things give this away as a Windows host. We will focus on those here in a minute.  Look carefully at the bottom of the shell session. We can see the point labeled <code>OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_10</code> and <code>OS details: Microsoft Windows 10 1709 - 1909</code>. Nmap made this guess based on several different metrics it derives from the TCP/IP stack. It uses those qualities to determine the OS as it checks it against a database of OS fingerprints. In this case, Nmap has determined that our host is a Windows 10 machine with a revision level between 1709 &amp; 1909.</p>
<p>If you run into issues and the scans turn up little results, attempt again with the <code>-A</code> and <code>-Pn</code> options. This will perform a different scan and may work. For more info on how this process works, check out this article from the <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-os-detection.html">Nmap Documentation</a>. Be careful of this detection method. Implementing a firewall or other security features can obscure the host or mess the results up. When possible, use more than one check to make a determination.</p>

<p>Now that we know we are dealing with a Windows 10 host, we need to enumerate the services we can see to determine if we have a potential avenue of exploitation. To perform banner grabbing, we can use several different tools. Netcat, Nmap, and many others can perform the enumeration we need, but for this instance, we will look at a simple Nmap script called <code>banner.nse</code>. For each port Nmap sees as up, it will attempt to connect to the port and glean any information it can from it. In the session below, Nmap tried to connect to each port, but the only ports to give back a response were ports 902 and 912. Based on the page banner, they have something to do with VMWare Workstation. We can attempt to find an exploit dealing with that protocol, or we can further enumerate the other ports. In a real pentest, you will want to be as thorough as possible, making sure you have the full lay of the land.</p>

<p>The examples shown above are just a few ways to help fingerprint and determine if a host is a Windows machine. It is by no means an exhaustive list, and there are many other checks you can do. Now that we have discussed fingerprinting let's look at several file types and what they can be used for when building out payloads.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Bats, DLLs, &amp; MSI Files, Oh My!</h2>
<p>When it comes to creating payloads for Windows hosts, we have plenty of options to choose from. DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use. Each file type can accomplish different things for us, but what they all have in common is that they are executable on a host. Try to keep your delivery mechanism for the payload in mind, as this can determine what type of payload you use.</p>
<h4>Payload Types to Consider</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library">DLLs</a> A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://commandwindows.com/batch.htm">Batch</a> Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of <code>.bat</code>. We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-vbscript.html">VBS</a> VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-file-extensions">MSI</a> <code>.MSI</code> files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run <code>msiexec</code> to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1">Powershell</a> Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we understand what each type of Windows file can be used for let's discuss some basic tools, tactics, and procedures for building our payloads and delivering them onto the host to land a shell.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Tools, Tactics, and Procedures for Payload Generation, Transfer, and Execution</h2>
<p>Below you will find examples of different payload generation methods and ways to transfer our payloads to the victim. We will talk about some of these methods at a high level since our focus is on the payload generation itself and the different ways to acquire a shell on the target.</p>
<h4>Payload Generation</h4>
<p>We have plenty of good options for dealing with generating payloads to use against Windows hosts. We touched on some of these already in previous sections. For example, the Metasploit-Framework and MSFVenom is a very handy way to generate payloads since it is OS agnostic. The table below lays out some of our options. However, this is not an exhaustive list, and new resources come out daily.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Payload Transfer and Execution:</h4>
<p>Besides the vectors of web-drive-by, phishing emails, or dead drops, Windows hosts can provide us with several other avenues of payload delivery. The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Impacket</code>: <a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket">Impacket</a> is a toolset built-in Python that provides us a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with <code>psexec</code>, <code>smbclient</code>, <code>wmi</code>, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Download%20and%20Execute.md">Payloads All The Things</a>: is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.</li>
<li>
<code>SMB</code>: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.</li>
<li>
<code>Remote execution via MSF</code>: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.</li>
<li>
<code>Other Protocols</code>: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know what tools, tactics, and procedures we can use to transfer our payloads, let's check out an example compromise process.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Example Compromise Walkthrough</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enumerate The Host</li>
</ol>
<p>Ping, Netcat, Nmap scans, and even Metasploit are all good options to start enumerating our potential victims. To start this time, we will utilize an Nmap scan. The enumeration portion of any exploit chain is arguably the most critical piece of the puzzle. Understanding the target and what makes it tick will raise your chances of gaining a shell.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>We figured out a few things during scanning &amp; validation of the example host in question. It is running <code>Windows Server 2016 Standard 6.3</code>. We have the hostname now, and we know it is not in a domain and is running several services. Now that we have gathered some information let's determine our potential exploit path.<br/>
<code>IIS</code> could be a potential path, attempting to access the host over SMB utilizing a tool like Impacket or authenticating if we had credentials could do it, and from an OS perspective, there may be a route for an RCE as well. MS17-010 (EternalBlue) has been known to affect hosts ranging from Windows 2008 to  Server 2016. With this in mind, it could be a solid bet that our victim is vulnerable since it falls in that window. Let's validate that using a builtin auxiliary check from <code>Metasploit</code>, <code>auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010</code>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Search for and decide on an exploit path</li>
</ol>
<p>Open <code>msfconsole</code> and search for EternalBlue, or you can use the string in the session below to use the check. Set the RHOSTS field with the target's IP address and initiate the scan. As can be seen in the options for the module, you can fill in more of the SMB settings, but it is not necessary. They will help to make the check more likely to succeed. When ready, type <code>run</code>.</p>

<p>Success! We have landed our exploit and gained a shell session. A <code>SYSTEM</code> level shell at that. As seen in the earlier MSF modules, now that we have an open session through Meterpreter, we are presented with the <code>meterpreter &gt; </code> prompt. From here, we can utilize Meterpreter to run further commands to gather system information, steal user credentials, or use another post-exploitation module against the host. If you wish to interact with the host directly, you can also drop into an interactive shell session on the host from Meterpreter.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>When we executed the Meterpreter command <code>shell</code>, it started another process on the host and dropped us into a system shell. Can you determine what we are in from the prompt? Just seeing <code>C:\Windows\system32&gt;</code> can clue us in that we are just in a <code>cmd.exe shell</code>. To make sure, simply running the command help from within the shell will also let you know. If we were dropped into PowerShell, our prompt would look like <code>PS C:\Windows\system32&gt;</code>. The PS in front lets us know it is a PowerShell session. Congrats on dropping into a shell on our latest exploited Windows host.</p>
<p>Now that we have run through a sample compromise process let's examine the shells you can see when you land on the host.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>CMD-Prompt and Power[Shell]s for Fun and Profit.</h2>
<p>We are fortunate with Windows hosts to have not one but two choices for shells to utilize by default. Now you may be wondering:</p>
<p><code>Which one is the right one to use?</code></p>
<p>The answer is simple, the one that provides you with the capability you need at the time. Compare <code>cmd</code> and <code>PowerShell</code> for a minute to get a sense of what they offer and when it would be best to pick one over the other.</p>
<p>CMD shell is the original MS-DOS shell built into Windows. It was made for basic interaction and I.T. operations on a host. Some simple automation could be achieved with batch files, but that was all. Powershell came along with a purpose to expand the capabilities of cmd. PowerShell understands the native MS-DOS commands utilized in CMD and a whole new set of commands based in .NET. New self-sufficient modules can also be implemented into PowerShell with cmdlets. CMD prompt deals with text input and output while Powershell utilizes .NET objects for all input and output. Another important consideration is that CMD does not keep a record of the commands used during the session whereas, PowerShell does. So in the context of being stealthy, executing commands with cmd will leave less of a trace on the host. Other potential problems such as <code>Execution Policy</code> and <code>User Account Control (UAC)</code> can inhibit your ability to execute commands and scripts on the host. These considerations affect <code>PowerShell</code> but not cmd. Another big concern to take into account is the age of the host. If you land on a Windows XP or older host ( yes, it's still possible..) PowerShell is not present, so your only option will be cmd. PowerShell did not come to fruition until Windows 7. So to sum it all up:</p>
<p>Use <code>CMD</code> when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.</li>
<li>When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.</li>
<li>When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.</li>
<li>When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <code>PowerShell</code> when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.</li>
<li>When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.</li>
<li>When being stealthy is of lesser concern.</li>
<li>If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.</li>
<li>If your scripts set and use Aliases.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>WSL and PowerShell For Linux</h2>
<p>The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a powerful new tool that has been introduced to Windows hosts that provides a virtual Linux environment built into your host. We mention this because the rapidly changing landscape of operating systems may very well allow for novel ways of gaining access to a host. When writing this module, several examples of malware in the wild were attempting to utilize Python3 and Linux binaries to download and install payloads onto a Windows host via WSL. Much like in this post <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-malware-uses-windows-subsystem-for-linux-for-stealthy-attacks/">here</a>, attackers are also using built-in Python libraries that are native to both Windows and Linux alongside PowerShell to perform other actions on the host. One other thing to note is currently, any network requests or functions executed to or from the WSL instance are not parsed by the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender, making it a bit of a blind spot on the host.</p>
<p>The same issues can currently be found via PowerShell Core, which can be installed on Linux operating systems and carry over many normal PowerShell functions. These two concepts are exceptionally sneaky because, to date, not much is known about the vectors of attack or ways to watch for them. But attacks aimed at these features have been seen to avoid AV and EDR detection mechanisms. These concepts are a bit advanced for this module but look for them in a future module.</p>
