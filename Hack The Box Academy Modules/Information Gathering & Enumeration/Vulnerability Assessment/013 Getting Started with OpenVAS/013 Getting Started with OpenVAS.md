<h2>Installing Package</h2>
<p>First, we can start by installing the tool:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">[!bash!]$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y full-upgrade
[!bash!]$ sudo apt-get install gvm &amp;&amp; openvas
</code></pre>
<p>Next, to begin the installation process, we can run the following command below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">[!bash!]$ gvm-setup
</code></pre>
<p>This will begin the setup process and take up to 30 minutes.</p>
