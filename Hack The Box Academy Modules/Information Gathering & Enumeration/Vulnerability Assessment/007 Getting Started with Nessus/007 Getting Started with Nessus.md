<h1>Getting Started with Nessus</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Let's see how we can download and set up Nessus for its first use so that we can start learning its various features. Feel free to follow along and set up a Nessus instance on your own VM. For the interactive portions of this module, we provide a lab instance of Nessus and another with OpenVAS installed.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Downloading Nessus</h2>
<p>To download Nessus, we can navigate to its <a href="https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true">Download Page</a> to download the correct Nessus binary for our system. We will be downloading the Debian package for <code>Ubuntu</code> for this walkthrough.
<img alt="Nessus download page showing Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb for Ubuntu 9.10/10.04, 46.3 MB, dated Aug 10, 2021." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/openvas/deb.png"/></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Requesting Free License</h2>
<p>Next, we can visit the <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code">Activation Code Page</a> to request a Nessus Activation Code, which is necessary to get the free version of Nessus:
<img alt="Nessus Professional offers free trial and purchase options for security pros. Nessus Essentials is a free vulnerability scanner for educators and students, allowing scanning of 16 IPs." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/nessus/register.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="Nessus activation code prompt: 'Need an Activation Code? Get Activation Code button to complete installation." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/nessus/registrationcode.png"/></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Installing Package</h2>
<p>With both the binary and activation code in hand, we can now install the Nessus package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">[!bash!]$ dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb

Selecting previously unselected package nessus.

</code></pre>
<hr/>
<h2>Starting Nessus</h2>
<p>Once we have Nessus installed, we can start the Nessus Service:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">[!bash!]$ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<h2>Accessing Nessus</h2>
<p>To access Nessus, we can navigate to <code>https://localhost:8834</code>. Once we arrive at the setup page, we should select <code>Nessus Essentials</code> for the free version, and then we can enter our activation code:

<p>Once we enter our activation code, we can set up a user with a <code>secure</code> password for our Nessus account. Then, the plugins will begin to compile once this step is completed:

<p class="mb-0"><b>Note:</b> The VM provided at the <code>Nessus Skills Assessment</code> section has Nessus pre-installed and the targets running. You can go to that section and start the VM and use Nessus throughout the module, which can be accessed at <code>https:// &lt; IP &gt;:8834</code>. The Nessus credentials are: <code>htb-student</code>:<code>HTB_@cademy_student!</code>. You may also use these credentials to SSH into the target VM to configure Nessus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, once the setup is complete, we can start creating scans, scan policies, plugin rules, and customizing settings. The <code>Settings</code> page has a wealth of options such as setting up a Proxy Server or SMTP server, standard account management options, and advanced settings to customize the user interface, scanning, logging, performance, and security options.</p>
<p><img alt="Nessus Advanced Settings page showing tabs for User Interface, Scanning, Logging, Performance, Security, and Miscellaneous.
