<h1>Exporting The Results</h1>
<hr/>
<p>OpenVAS provides the scan results in a report that can be accessed when you are on the <code>Scans</code> page, as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="Greenbone Security Assistant dashboard showing 5 tasks by severity and status. Four tasks are high severity, one is low. Windows_basic_authed has the most high results." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/openvas/viewingreport.png"/></p>
<p>Once you click the report, you can view the scan results and operating system information, open ports, services, etc., in other tabs in the scan report.</p>
<p><img alt="Greenbone Security Assistant report from Feb 13, 2022, showing vulnerabilities like outdated scan engine and anonymous FTP login, with severities ranging from high to low." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/openvas/openvas_reports.png"/></p>

<h2>Exporting Formats</h2>
<p>There are various export formats for reporting purposes, including XML, CSV, PDF, ITG, and TXT. If you choose to export your report out as an XML, you can leverage various XML parsers to view the data in an easier to read format.</p>
<p><img alt="Greenbone Security Assistant report format selection with options for Anonymous XML, CSV, ITG, PDF, TXT, and XML. Include notes and overrides." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/openvas/reportformat.png"/></p>
<p>We will export our results in XML and use the <a href="https://github.com/TheGroundZero/openvasreporting">openvasreporting</a> tool by the TheGroundZero. The <code>openvasreporting</code> tool offers various options when generating output. We are using the standard option for an Excel file for this report.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">[!bash!]$ python3 -m openvasreporting -i report-2bf466b5-627d-4659-bea6-1758b43235b1.xml -f xlsx
</code></pre>
<p>This command will generate an excel document similar to the one below:</p>
