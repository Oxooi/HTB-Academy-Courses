<p>Searching for and identifying employees on social media platforms can also reveal a lot about the teams' infrastructure and makeup. This, in turn, can lead to us identifying which technologies, programming languages, and even software applications are being used. To a large extent, we will also be able to assess each person's focus based on their skills. The posts and material shared with others are also a great indicator of what the person is currently engaged in and what that person currently feels is important to share with others.</p>
<p>Employees can be identified on various business networks such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.xing.de">Xing</a>. Job postings from companies can also tell us a lot about their infrastructure and give us clues about what we should be looking for.</p>

<p>From a job post like this, we can see, for example, which programming languages are preferred: <code>Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl</code>. It also required that the applicant be familiar with different databases, such as: <code>PostgreSQL, Mysql, and Oracle</code>. In addition, we know that different frameworks are used for web application development, such as: <code>Flask, Django, ASP.NET, Spring</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we use <code>REST APIs, Github, SVN, and Perforce</code>. The job offer also results that the company works with Atlassian Suite, and therefore there may be resources that we could potentially access. We can see some skills and projects from the career history that give us a reasonable estimate of the employee's knowledge.</p>
<h4>LinkedIn - Employee #1 About</h4>

<p>We try to make business contacts on social media sites and prove to visitors what skills we bring to the table, which inevitably leads to us sharing with the public what we know and what we have learned so far. Companies always hire employees whose skills they can use and apply to the business. For example, we know that Flask and Django are web frameworks for the Python programming language.</p>
<p>If we do a little search for Django security misconfigurations, we will eventually come across the following <a href="https://github.com/boomcamp/django-security">Github repository</a> that describes OWASP Top10 for Django. We can use this to understand the inner structure of Django and how it works. The best practices also often tell us what to look for. Because many blindly trust them and even name many of the files as shown in the instructions.</p>
<h4>Github</h4>

<p><img alt="Code snippet defining a function to decode a JWT with a payload, secret, and redacted JWT string." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/github2.png"/></p>
<p>Showing our projects can, of course, be of great advantage to make new business contacts and possibly even get a new job, but on the other hand, it can lead to mistakes that will be very difficult to fix. For example, in one of the files, we can discover the employee's personal email address, and upon deeper investigation, the web application has a hardcoded <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT token</a>.</p>
<h4>LinkedIn - Employee #2 Career</h4>
<p><img alt="Profile showing roles: Vice President Software Engineer and Associate Software Engineer. Responsibilities include leading CRM mobile app development and delivering the BrokerVotes system. Skills listed: Java, React, Slang, Elastic, Kafka." src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/linkedin-pers1.png"/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> offers a comprehensive search for employed, sorted by connections, locations, companies, school, industry, profile language, services, names, titles, and more. Understandably, the more detailed information we provide there, the fewer results we get. Therefore, we should think carefully about the purpose of performing the search.</p>
<p>Suppose we are trying to find the infrastructure and technology the company is most likely to use. We should look for technical employees who work both in development and security. Because based on the security area and the employees who work in that area, we will also be able to determine what security measures the company has put in place to secure itself.</p>
