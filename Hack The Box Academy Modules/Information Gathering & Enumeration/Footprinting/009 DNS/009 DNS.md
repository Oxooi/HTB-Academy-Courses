<h1>DNS</h1>
<hr/>
<p><code>Domain Name System</code> (<code>DNS</code>) is an integral part of the Internet. For example, through domain names, such as <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com">academy.hackthebox.com</a> or <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu">www.hackthebox.com</a>, we can reach the web servers that the hosting provider has assigned one or more specific IP addresses. DNS is a system for resolving computer names into IP addresses, and it does not have a central database. Simplified, we can imagine it like a library with many different phone books. The information is distributed over many thousands of name servers. Globally distributed DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses and thus control which server a user can reach via a particular domain. There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS root server</li>
<li>Authoritative name server</li>
<li>Non-authoritative name server</li>
<li>Caching server</li>
<li>Forwarding server</li>
<li>Resolver</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><code>DNS Root Server</code></td>
<td>The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (<code>TLD</code>). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The <a href="https://www.icann.org/">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (<code>ICANN</code>) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are <code>13</code> such root servers around the globe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Authoritative Nameserver</code></td>
<td>Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Non-authoritative Nameserver</code></td>
<td>Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Caching DNS Server</code></td>
<td>Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Forwarding Server</code></td>
<td>Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Resolver</code></td>
<td>Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.</td>

<p>DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply <code>DNS over TLS</code> (<code>DoT</code>) or <code>DNS over HTTPS</code> (<code>DoH</code>) here. In addition, the network protocol <code>DNSCrypt</code> also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.</p>
<p>However, the DNS does not only link computer names and IP addresses. It also stores and outputs additional information about the services associated with a domain. A DNS query can therefore also be used, for example, to determine which computer serves as the e-mail server for the domain in question or what the domain's name servers are called.</p>

<p>Different <code>DNS records</code> are used for the DNS queries, which all have various tasks. Moreover, separate entries exist for different functions since we can set up mail servers and other servers for a domain.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>There are many different configuration types for DNS. Therefore, we will only discuss the most important ones to illustrate better the functional principle from an administrative point of view. All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files:</p>
<ol>
<li>local DNS configuration files</li>
<li>zone files</li>
<li>reverse name resolution files</li>
</ol>
<p>The DNS server <a href="https://www.isc.org/bind/">Bind9</a> is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (<code>named.conf</code>) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>named.conf.local</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>named.conf.options</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>named.conf.log</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It contains the associated RFC where we can customize the server to our needs and our domain structure with the individual zones for different domains. The configuration file <code>named.conf</code> is divided into several options that control the behavior of the name server. A distinction is made between <code>global options</code> and <code>zone options</code>.</p>
<p>Global options are general and affect all zones. A zone option only affects the zone to which it is assigned. Options not listed in named.conf have default values. If an option is both global and zone-specific, then the zone option takes precedence.</p>
<h4>Local DNS Configuration</h4>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

//
// Do any local configuration here
//

// Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
// organization
//include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
zone "domain.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.domain.com";
    allow-update { key rndc-key; };
};
</code></pre>
<p>In this file, we can define the different zones. These zones are divided into individual files, which in most cases are mainly intended for one domain only. Exceptions are ISP and public DNS servers. In addition, many different options extend or reduce the functionality. We can look these up on the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Bind9">documentation</a> of Bind9.</p>
<p>A <code>zone file</code> is a text file that describes a DNS zone with the BIND file format. In other words it is a point of delegation in the DNS tree. The BIND file format is the industry-preferred zone file format and is now well established in DNS server software. A zone file describes a zone completely. There must be precisely one <code>SOA</code> record and at least one <code>NS</code> record. The SOA resource record is usually located at the beginning of a zone file. The main goal of these global rules is to improve the readability of zone files. A syntax error usually results in the entire zone file being considered unusable. The name server behaves similarly as if this zone did not exist. It responds to DNS queries with a <code>SERVFAIL</code> error message.</p>
<p>In short, here, all <code>forward records</code> are entered according to the BIND format. This allows the DNS server to identify which domain, hostname, and role the IP addresses belong to. In simple terms, this is the phone book where the DNS server looks up the addresses for the domains it is searching for.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>For the IP address to be resolved from the <code>Fully Qualified Domain Name</code> (<code>FQDN</code>), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file. In this file, the computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address, which corresponds to the respective host, using a <code>PTR</code> record. The PTR records are responsible for the reverse translation of IP addresses into names, as we have already seen in the above table.</p>

<h2>Dangerous Settings</h2>
<p>There are many ways in which a DNS server can be attacked. For example, a list of vulnerabilities targeting the BIND9 server can be found at <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/144/ISC-Bind.html?vendor_id=64">CVEdetails</a>. In addition, SecurityTrails provides a short <a href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/most-popular-types-dns-attacks">list</a> of the most popular attacks on DNS servers.</p>
<p>Some of the settings we can see below lead to these vulnerabilities, among others. Because DNS can get very complicated and it is very easy for errors to creep into this service, forcing an administrator to work around the problem until they find an exact solution. This often leads to elements being released so that parts of the infrastructure function as planned and desired. In such cases, functionality has a higher priority than security, which leads to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>Footprinting the Service</h2>
<p>The footprinting at DNS servers is done as a result of the requests we send. So, first of all, the DNS server can be queried as to which other name servers are known. We do this using the NS record and the specification of the DNS server we want to query using the <code>@</code> character. This is because if there are other DNS servers, we can also use them and query the records. However, other DNS servers may be configured differently and, in addition, may be permanent for other zones.</p>

<p><code>Zone transfer</code> refers to the transfer of zones to another server in DNS, which generally happens over TCP port 53. This procedure is abbreviated <code>Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone</code> (<code>AXFR</code>). Since a DNS failure usually has severe consequences for a company, the zone file is almost invariably kept identical on several name servers. When changes are made, it must be ensured that all servers have the same data. Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer. Using a secret key <code>rndc-key</code>, which we have seen initially in the default configuration, the servers make sure that they communicate with their own master or slave. Zone transfer involves the mere transfer of files or records and the detection of discrepancies in the data sets of the servers involved.</p>
<p>The original data of a zone is located on a DNS server, which is called the <code>primary</code> name server for this zone. However, to increase the reliability, realize a simple load distribution, or protect the primary from attacks, one or more additional servers are installed in practice in almost all cases, which are called <code>secondary</code> name servers for this zone. For some <code>Top-Level Domains</code> (<code>TLDs</code>), making zone files for the <code>Second Level Domains</code> accessible on at least two servers is mandatory.</p>
<p>DNS entries are generally only created, modified, or deleted on the primary. This can be done by manually editing the relevant zone file or automatically by a dynamic update from a database. A DNS server that serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file is called a master. A DNS server that obtains zone data from a master is called a slave. A primary is always a master, while a secondary can be both a slave and a master.</p>
<p>The slave fetches the <code>SOA</code> record of the relevant zone from the master at certain intervals, the so-called refresh time, usually one hour, and compares the serial numbers. If the serial number of the SOA record of the master is greater than that of the slave, the data sets no longer match.</p>

<p>The individual <code>A</code> records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt">SecLists</a>.</p>
<p>An option would be to execute a <code>for-loop</code> in Bash that lists these entries and sends the corresponding query to the desired DNS server.</p>
